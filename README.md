# ayuno-rollCount
RollCount counts dice rolls during a game session. It tracks 1 configuration of dice for 1 game. So for Settlers of Catan which uses 2d6 (2 rolls of a 6 sided die) we would track dice rolls between 2 and 12, for 1d6 games we’d track rolls between 1 and 6, and for D&amp;D and the like (3d6) we’d track 3 to 18.
